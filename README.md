# AI Playground

This repository serves as a testing ground for AI agents focused on generating code. It's a space to experiment with different AI models, prompts, and workflows to explore the capabilities and limitations of AI in software development.

## Goals

- **Evaluate AI code generation:** Assess the quality, correctness, and efficiency of code produced by various AI models.
- **Develop effective prompting strategies:** Discover and document best practices for crafting prompts that yield optimal code generation results.
- **Explore AI-driven development workflows:** Experiment with integrating AI tools into different stages of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to debugging and refactoring.
- **Identify AI limitations and challenges:** Document areas where current AI models struggle with code generation and propose potential solutions or workarounds.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **`experiments/`**: Contains individual experiments with different AI models, prompts, and code generation tasks. Each experiment typically includes:
  - The prompt used.
  - The AI-generated code.
  - A brief analysis of the results, including correctness, efficiency, and adherence to requirements.
  - Any manual modifications or refinements made to the AI-generated code.
- **`tools/`**: Houses custom scripts or utilities developed to facilitate AI code generation, evaluation, or integration.
- **`docs/`**: Provides documentation, guides, and best practices related to AI code generation within this playground.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an interesting AI code generation experiment, a useful tool, or insights to share, please feel free to open a pull request.
